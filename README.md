# Clock-with-changing-background

I have created a real time clock with a background which changes depending on the time of day.  I created this so I could practice using Javascript. 

I enjoyed planning the project before starting to build it.  I found writing the JS to make the background most challenging but also the most rewarding when it finally worked.

During this project I have practiced, read and learnt about:
• Loop (for loop)
• if else
• Date object
• Variables
• add.EventListener
• getElementById

This has given me confidence to keep practicing JS.
